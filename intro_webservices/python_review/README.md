## Python review
The goal of this exercice is reading a local json data file and extract its content into a DataFrame

The following need to be done:
- Read the JSON file
- Parse the JSON
- Extract the data and store in a list of dictionaries with the following keys "firstname", "lastname", "address", "age", "job"
- Create a data frame from the list of dictionary
- Show the dataframe

Your code should be pushed in the right branch under your own folder just like the "dejaeger" folder
